        <h3>More Than a Magazine</h3>
        <p>
            *Through the Cracks* isn’t just a magazine. It’s the culmination of **six years of PhD research**, **published journal articles**, and **a book**—all dedicated to exposing the systemic failures that leave people with **co-existing mental health and substance use needs** without the support they deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
            This platform brings together **critical analysis, lived experiences, and policy discussions** to challenge the status quo. It’s about more than just identifying problems—it’s about advocating for **meaningful, evidence-based change**.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Because acknowledging the failures is only the first step—the real work is in building something better.</strong></p>

            <h3>What is *Through the Cracks*?</h3>
            <p>
                *Through the Cracks* is an independent magazine that challenges the **fragmented, failing systems** meant to support individuals with 
                **co-existing mental health and substance use challenges (CEMS)**. Our goal is to **bridge the gap between research, frontline experience, 
                and policy reform**, ensuring that real-world stories and evidence-based solutions shape the future of care.
            </p>

        <div class="about-box">
            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>The system is full of contradictions. People struggling with both mental health and substance use are often told:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“We can’t help you while you’re still using.”</li>
                <li>“You need stable accommodation first.”</li>
                <li>“Your mental health is too complex for this service.”</li>
                <li>“You don’t meet the criteria.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These **bureaucratic failures create a cycle of exclusion**—leaving individuals without the support they desperately need. 
            *Through the Cracks* exists to **call this out, amplify voices from the margins, and push for systemic reform.**</p>

            <h3>Who’s Behind This?</h3>
            <p>
                *Through the Cracks* is founded by **[Your Name]**, a **PhD researcher, author, and frontline mental health social worker** with 
                over **15 years of experience** in the intersection of **mental health, substance use, and social justice**.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your PhD research at **Staffordshire University** introduced the **Integrated Morphogenetic Care Model (IMCM)**—a framework 
                designed to close service gaps and provide **holistic, person-centered support** for individuals with **co-existing mental health and substance use disorders (CEMS)**.

                that follows the life of *Danny*, a man caught between mental health services, addiction treatment, and homelessness.

            <p>Your research, policy reports, and advocacy work push for **humanistic, integrated approaches** to care.</p>
