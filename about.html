        <h2>About *Through the Cracks*</h2>
        <p>A quarterly magazine dedicated to exposing systemic failures in mental health and substance use care—and advocating for change.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
        <h3>What is *Through the Cracks*?</h3>
        <p>
            *Through the Cracks* is an independent magazine that challenges the **fragmented, failing systems** meant to support individuals with 
            **co-existing mental health and substance use challenges (CEMS)**. Our goal is to **bridge the gap between research, frontline experience, 
            and policy reform**, ensuring that real-world stories and evidence-based solutions shape the future of care.
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
            The system is full of contradictions. People struggling with both mental health and substance use are often told:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>“We can’t help you while you’re still using.”</li>
            <li>“You need stable accommodation first.”</li>
            <li>“Your mental health is too complex for this service.”</li>
            <li>“You don’t meet the criteria.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These **bureaucratic failures create a cycle of exclusion**—leaving individuals without the support they desperately need. 
            *Through the Cracks* exists to **call this out, amplify voices from the margins, and push for systemic reform.**
        </p>

        <h3>Who’s Behind This?</h3>
        <p>
            *Through the Cracks* is founded by **[Your Name]**, a **PhD researcher, author, and frontline mental health social worker** with 
            over **15 years of experience** in the intersection of **mental health, substance use, and social justice**.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your work is deeply rooted in both **academic research and real-world practice**. You completed your **PhD at Staffordshire University**, 
            focusing on systemic failures in the treatment of individuals with **co-existing mental health and substance use disorders (CEMS)**. 
            Your thesis, <em>“Beyond Dual Diagnosis: From Fragmentation to Integration”</em>, introduces the 
            **Integrated Morphogenetic Care Model (IMCM)**—a framework designed to close service gaps and build **holistic, person-centered support systems**.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Work & Impact</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to your frontline experience, you are also the author of **Through the Cracks (the book)**, a **fiction-meets-reality narrative** 
            that follows the life of *Danny*, a man who has spent decades caught between mental health services, addiction treatment, and homelessness. 
            The book critiques how addiction is wrongly framed as a **moral failing** or **disease**, rather than being understood as a response to 
            **pain, trauma, and systemic neglect**.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your work doesn’t stop there. You have authored numerous **articles, policy reports, and research papers** advocating for change—pushing for a **humanistic, integrated approach** to mental health and addiction treatment.
        </p>
