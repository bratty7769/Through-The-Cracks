            <h2>Why This Manifesto Matters</h2>
            <p>The failure to address co-existing mental health and substance use difficulties (CEMS) is one of the greatest systemic injustices of our time. Current care models remain fragmented, denying individuals the dignity, support, and holistic care they need.</p>
            <p>This manifesto calls for a radical shift in policy, service provision, and societal understanding to end the cycle of exclusion and systemic neglect.</p>
